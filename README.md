# Using-TCP-File-Transfer-Between-Devices-Over-the-Same-Network
A C# application that enables file sharing between two devices connected in the same network using TCP.

According to TechTarget, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that specifies how a network conversation in which application programs may share data can be formed and maintained. TCP operates in accordance with Internet Protocol (IP), which determines how computers transmit data packets to each other. This protocol enables two endpoints in a shared computer network to create a connection that allows data to be transmitted in two directions. Any data loss is detected and immediately corrected, which is why TCP is often referred to as a reliable protocol. TCP is typically used to coordinate information in such a way that safe transmission between the server and the client is guaranteed.â€“ With this being said, TCP is generally used to arrange data in such a way that secure transmission between the server and the client is assured. It guarantees, irrespective of the number, the integrity of data sent over the network. For this purpose, data from other higher-level protocols that enable all transmitted data to arrive are used to transmit data.

The goal of creating this application is to simulate file sharing between two devices connected in the same network using TCP and explore how the operating system helps in terms of file management and networking.
